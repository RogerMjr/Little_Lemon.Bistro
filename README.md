Database Connectivity: The Django application can be configured to connect to a MySQL database. This involves updating the database settings in the Django project's settings file to specify the MySQL database credentials, such as the host, port, database name, username, and password.
Little Lemon Restaurant Booking API: The application can include a booking API that allows users to make reservations for tables at the restaurant. The API can be implemented using Django Rest Framework (DRF) to provide a RESTful interface for managing bookings.
API Endpoints: The booking API can define endpoints such as /bookings or /reservations to handle booking-related operations.
Request and Response Format: The API endpoints can accept JSON or form data in the request payload, containing information such as the user's name, contact details, preferred date and time, number of guests, and any additional comments.
